# OpenWrt-IoT-IDS-Privacy
OpenWrt Internet of Things Intrusion Detection and Privacy Protection Package

## capture_packets.py TODOs
1) Set the count of the packets to sniff to 0 before adding it to the OpenWrt package
2) Remove the MAC address validation from the script, it will likely be performed when the user inputs them, before the config file is created
